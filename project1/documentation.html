                    <div class="divider"></div>

                     <p> In this period I created my game proposal content and images and stored them in a markdown file.</p>

                <li>September 25th, 2017:

                    <div class="divider"></div>

                    <p>During this time I sketched out the layout of my website on some paper and developed a large amount of the HTML code for all pages of my website.</p>
                </li>


             
                
                
                <li>September 26th, 2017:

                    <div class="divider"></div>

                    <p>I worked heavily on refining the HTML and added basic CSS. There was still no images at this point and only placeholder colors. However, most of all of the written content (excluding documentation) was located in its appropriate sections. By this time there was a navigation system to travel between pages.</p>
                </li>


          
                
                
                <li>September 27th, 2017:

                    <div class="divider"></div>

                    <p>I continued working on the HTML and CSS code, refining proximity and alignment. I finished an in-page navigation system to immediately link to specific headers. Additionally there was a critique session between classmates that provided me with good feedback regarding the pros and cons of the site. The pros included good alignment, proximity, navigation and content depth while the cons centered on poor contrast, bad colors and a lack of responsive design.</p>

                <li>September 28th, 2017:

                    <div class="divider"></div>

                    <p>I changed colors of text and blocks to be more appealing and to fix contrast. Additionally, I chose better images (with a nature theme) and darkened them to make sure that they wouldn't detract from the written content, fixed some issues that were caused by invalid HTML and CSS, and started working with media queries.</p>
                </li>

                    <p> I finished up the remainder of the project (I finalized media queries, finished implementing navigation for mobile, fixed the image resolutions, finished adding documentation, spell-checked
                    content, finished commenting and fixed some various bugs).</p>

                    <li> My website doesn't represent any templates or in class exercises.
                    I utilized adobe color wheel to choose an apropriate color scheme. The alignment and proximity
                    of the elements of my page were the product of immense effort and care. A large amount of time went
                    into making sure that the fonts of the page were consistent.</li>
                    
                   
                        
                    <li> I have given my best effort in attempting to produce a website whose standards match the C.R.A.P. principles:
                    The content has been well thought out and scrutinized. The presence of repetition is obvious on every page.
                    All of the content is alligned vertically at the middle of the page. Lastly, the proximity of most all of the
                    content and containers of the page has been thoughtfully chosen. </li>
                    
                      
                        
                    <li>Inter-page navigation is consistent between all pages of the site while the only page that doesn't
                    have an index is the Game Page. This is because the banners were removed to prevent distraction. Additionally,
                    the page isn't long enough to where having an index would really matter. With this being said, the viewer
                    can always easily determine where they are and where they want to go.</li>
                    
                   
                        
                    <li>Text size is sufficient and easy to read.</li>
                    
                
                        
                    <li>The media queries that I utilized are able to support a wide variety of screen widths, including those
                    480px and below. The queries resize the elements of the screen (and remove them) to facilitate the user's interaction
                    with the website.</li>
